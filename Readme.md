# Community-Coder-Dashboard
The purpose of this project is to have a place for students who are just learning to code to have a community dashboard to access several coding resources. The user will be able to select from several options to create their own customized dashboard of coding options. The site provides four different options: Train Your Skills, Chat Room, Resource Sharing, and a Success Tracker.

# User Story
 AS A student, I WANT to be able to log in the Community Coding Dashboard 
 SO I CAN track my study-time, connect with other students and select resources to cater to my learning needs.
